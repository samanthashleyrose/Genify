#### Creating a Playlist
Initiating playlist creation is effortless. Select "Generate Playlist" to kickstart the process. Users have the flexibility to choose up to 5 interests spanning genres and artists. A convenient countdown feature ensures users can easily track their progress across pages.

Specify the desired number of songs for the playlist (ranging from 5 to 100) and give your new playlist a name. Upon confirming your selections by clicking "Generate Playlist," you'll be redirected to the Generate Playlist page, which provides insightful information used in crafting the playlist, alongside a preview icon.

Upon revisiting your Spotify account, you'll discover the curated playlist waiting for you, perfectly tailored to your preferences.
